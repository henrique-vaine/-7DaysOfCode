Alura challenge to improve CSS skills.
As i'm iniciating my studies about front-end development, i've participated in this Alura challenge in order to practice my learnings in HTML and CSS.
I'm pretty sure there are a lot to improve, but i'm happy to complete this one and look forward to become more familiar with all this stuff.
Suggestions are welcome!
